									<p>Someday, 2017</p>
									<h3 class="major">LIT FEST</h3>
									<p>National Public School has added yet another feather to its cap of achievements with its maiden inter-school literature fest- ‘Lit Up’. The fest was without doubt a roaring success. It provided the participants an opportunity to showcase their literary skills. The middle schoolers for the first time participated in events like stand-up comedy and screen play writing. ‘Slam poetry’ was a treat to the audience as the students were at their creative best. ‘Confrontation’, the debate, saw the participants battle it out with maturity and poise. ‘Split Up’ –the Stand-up Comedy- had the audience in splits. NPS Indiranagar walked home with the overall championship tropht. Kudos to the team of students, who worked tirelessly to ensure the flawless execution of the events. It was not only entertaining and enjoyable but was also a good learning experience for the students of the organising school and the participating school.</p>
