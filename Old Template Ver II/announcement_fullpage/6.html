									<h3 class="major">THE RECURRING SIN</h3>
									<p>It was finally here . What weeks (okay, maybe days) of studying, revising and practicing had geared us up for.The Periodic Tests. The PTs were supposed to be similar to our regular FAs. But, with all the drama CBSE decided to throw at us and the near heart-attacks our teachers suffered explaining the new exam structure, the PTs seemed like the very determiners of our future. It was an exam everyone had already decided to ace. Or at least that’s how it started out. The sudden wave of inspiration was gone almost as quick as it came. Motivation was soon replaced by dread. The immeasurable amount of portions (it wasn’t so vast but it felt that way two days before the exam), seemed impossible to even complete and the three revisions that were planned out seemed like a herculean task. Everything we learned about exam and study skills went out of the window and the classroom had a very depressing and damp atmosphere. People who I’ve never seen reading a textbook before, were poring over the pages like the fate of the world depended on it. The exams itself seemed to pass by smoothly. While there had been tears and complaints all around, it finally seemed to dawn on us that these were just the regular exams and that there was nothing out of the ordinary. In the end, we resorted to consoling ourselves by pointing out that the final grade was the best two out of three and that we would, like always, do better next time. Hopefully next time, we’ll actually be able to keep that promise.</p>

									<h3 class="major">DUNKIRK – A MOVIE REVIEW</h3>
									<p>This much awaited film is yet another marvellous and well directed creation of Christopher Nolan. Unlike his other films 'Inception' and 'Interstellar', this film is set in the past, and keeps the audience enraptured till the very last delivery. A combination of vivid sets, a strong script and a gifted ensemble cast made the film a hit at the box office. This World War II thriller is based on the evacuation of the Allied troops from the coastal town of Dunkirk in France before the coming of the Nazi forces. The troops are pushed to the beaches of Dunkirk from where they can practically see home, far in the distance across the English Channel. Nolan captures the true spirit of this historical event using three perspectives - land, air and water. Although these scenarios are vastly different, the people all have one purpose- to find their way back home to safety. This film is about more than just reveling in the victory at the end of the journey- it is about finding the meaning of life amidst the chaos of war. As much as there is action, there is also an insight into the life of soldiers, their emotions and dilemmas faced by them in numerous situations. The soldiers who sacrifice their lives for the protection of their people are now faced with a situation where they feel like they have let their people down. This film is emotionally satisfying and will leave you with little to say but a lot to think about. The star- studded cast helps bring the story to life by accurately portraying the dynamic emotions of a soldier. The film succeeded in capturing the essence of the Dunkirk evacuation perfectly. With breathtaking views of the English Channel and remarkable underwater cinematography .This film earns itself a 4.5/5 rating. If you are in the mood for something serious yet adventurous, this film is a definite must watch!</p>
